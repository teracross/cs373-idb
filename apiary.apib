We sat in the Turf Club which I guess is the nicest viewing area. There wasn't a bad table in the place, even the 2 tops which is what we had. The menu is mostly lunch type items, salad, sandwiches, burgers, with a few breakfast options, but the food was surprisingly good and very reasonably priced. I had the tuna melt and it was stuffed with tuna salad and cheese. The BF had the chicken caprese sandwich. The sandwich arrived, I looked up a second later and it was gone. He inhaled it,  he thought it was that good. The bread pudding was ok. The only thing that wasn't awesome was the service. Our waitress was very slow to come around and she didn't have much of a personality. Any time we needed anything I had to flag her down but who knows it could have been an off day for her. We walked around and went to the grandstand and outside viewing area as well. There are stadium type food booths and a couple of bars out there and it looked fun. We would definitely go back again and pay the full price. So worth it.",

So I take it back to the counter, point out the error and they take it back. I hear the manager correcting the staff, who mouths off to him. The manager comes back and says that the fixed sandwich will be right back out. They give me the same sandwich, with all the mayo still on it and a gallon of pink goo which I assume is the tomato Pesto. Not going back again. What a waste.",
