I came in to start another mini tour. I always love the food especially the pizza. The service is usually good, however today it sucked. We were seated at the bar 10 minutes before we were greeted by the bartender.  Not a full bar either. The food we ordered was out in a reasonable time and was delicious. My only issue today was with the bartender and the service we got.

The joint is a really nice sports bar and grill....I've never been to a sports bar that was so nice before, I thought I had the wrong place when I arrived.  The restaurant is well kept and looks like it just opened, at least by the cleanliness and decor.\n\nSince I was alone, I saddled up to the bar and decided to eat and have a few Beers while I watched the game.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I asked the bartender for her recommendation.  She suggested the Boneless Wings (\\$7.99) or the Sliders (\\$7.99 + \\$.50 w/Cheese).....I said, \"What the hell, let's go for both!\".  I asked her to make sure the Boneless Wings were really Spicy.  Since I had been in China for the past 10 days I was in the mood for some heat.....she said that their hottest wing sauce wasn't that hot....but that the cooks could whip up  a Habanero Sauce for me.  I asked her to have the Boneless Wings prepared with Hot Sauce and put the Habanero Sauce on the side, just to be on the safe side, LOL.  To wash it down, I had a 22 oz SunUp Trooper IPA (\\$5.50).\n\nI watched the Lakers vs Suns game for a while and made some new friends at the bar while I waited for my food.  After a short wait the first dish to come out was the Boneless Wings.  The Habanero Sauce was so Hot that when they placed it down in front of me I choked on the fumes....and this was with the Sauce on the Side!  I had to move the plate off to the side, just so I could breathe....perfect!  I took one piece of Boneless Wing, dipped it into the Habanero Sauce, and took a bite....wow, it packed a big punch!  Very spicy and soooo good!  The Chicken was moist and juicy and cooked just right.....not too crunchy and not too soft....and full of flavor.\n\nThe Sliders came out a few minutes later....so I left 1/2 my Wing order to go try the Sliders.  There were 4 Sliders on the plate.  I tried it with a little Blue Cheese Dressing.....yum!  Then I dipped them in a little Blue Cheese then with the Habanero Sauce that came with the Wings....even better!  I told the bartender to tell the cooks that their Habanero Sauce was a huge hit and to thank them for me.\n\nIt took me a while, but I devoured everything I ordered.  2 IPA's later and with a Lakers' loss in the making, I asked the bartender to change up the Beer order and asked for her recommendation.  She suggested the 4 Peaks Peach Ale (22 oz \\$5.50)....ok, I normally don't do Peach flavored Beer but went with it anyway.  I'm glad I did, it had a nice smooth finish and you could barely taste the Peach flavor....it didn't overwhelm the brew.\n\nDespite a Lakers loss, I had a great time and meal here.  Kudos to the staff for making a patron happy by whipping up a spicy Habanero Sauce on the fly....you can almost feel the heat in the pics I took.\n\nWill I return?

I'm looking forward to spending more quality time hanging at Blue 32!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

Not your typical bar-food menu - though plenty of those staples as well. The menu was a bit longer than most sports bar type establishments, and varied. I had the grilled shrimp w/ rice and broccoli which sounds incredibly boring and possibly bland - it was neither. Grilled shrimp can easily come out dry and/or rubbery and this dish was tender, flavorful and the rice was flavored with a cilantro lime sauce. So yummy! My husband had Buffalo chicken sandwich that he ooohed and aahed over, so I guess he loved it. \n\nI was pleased to be able to get a decent wine by the glass! They also offer many specialty cocktails in addition to beer (of course). \n\nSpacious, modern decor. Lots of big booths, plenty of seating and many large TVs for those of you specifically looking for a place to watch the game. \n\nAlso, the server was a new trainee who clearly had worked in restaurants before because she displayed absolutely no \"Newness\" and her trainer was helpful and attentive as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

It's located right off Scottsdale Road, easily visible from the street. There was no wait when we came (around 8PM) but very packed. We were seated at a bar top and were quickly greeted by our waiter. I decided to order a raspberry margarita, which was pretty good. I do prefer margaritas on the rocks and this one was frozen. I ordered a caesar salad to start and the chicken alfredo. The alfredo pasta came with rotini noodles, which I liked but reminded me slightly of a macaroni and cheese. The portion was HUGE though, definitely share or plan to take a lot home! Everything was good, the place has a bunch of TV's and the bar area with the TV on was really loud. If you don't like to watch sports while eating/drinking, I probably wouldn't come here. But, if you don't mind it or like it, it's a fun place to check out. \n\nOverall, I had a good time and would recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

(Now I have no reason to ever step in Zipp's again, I definitely won't miss the smell of dirty rags and the crappy food!) \n\nI decided to check it out on Saturday for lunch, I thought that I should try to preview it before it becomes packed during football season. Blue 32 is an upscale sports bar, the inside is crisp and clean and there are TONS of flat-screen TVs all over the place! The menu is huge....so many options and many of them unique that you don't see on a regular sports bar menu. \n\nWe started with a basket of onion rings, and wow, yummy! They batter was light, but they had added a touch of heat to the batter, that made them perfect for dunking in cool, creamy ranch dressing! \n\nI ordered the Shrimp & Bacon Quesadilla off of the appetizer section, which I though was a nice change from the standard chicken quesadilla (which they do have for traditionalists). The quesadilla was huge, filled with shrimp, bacon and cheese and served with guacamole and sour cream, it was amazing and big enough that I got to bring home leftovers! \n\nMy friends tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and the classic BLT. They both really liked their dishes, and like the quesadilla, both portions were big and required take home boxes! \n\nThis is my new go to place, I can't wait to try out more of the menu and watch 4 football games at once!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

I am on their email list and had received a coupon for two hours of bowling with shoes, food, etc for \\$7.99.  I asked for the special rate and was very rudely told that it doesn't apply during spring break and that lanes were \\$3+ and shoes were \\$4.50.  When I asked about who has spring break now he rudely replied Paradise Valley schools.  Really????  This was Scottsdale, wtf?\nSo I paid over \\$30 for three of us to bowl.  When I asked for two lanes (one w/ bumper for grandson) he acted really put out.\nWe had a good time, but both my daughter and myself have our own shoes and I felt ripped off and hate rude workers, so I was mad.\nThen afterwords we went to the game part of the place and almost every game was broken or did not give out tickets.  My grandson wanted to play ski ball he loves and they were broken too.  Of course the desk people could care less.\nWe will not be going back here again. Too many times they have treated us like crap and I would much rather take my money somewhere else where I am appreciated and provides even some sort of customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

Specifically I was in search of a Monte Cristo sandwich. Okay, not the healthiest choice to have a big ham and Swiss battered and deep fried then dusted with powdered sugar but it's been ages! Three of us tried Blue 32 out for lunch and were very impressed. \n\nIt's a big place with a section off the bar with high-top seating and an outdoor patio for whenever it may cool down, a big bar area and a relaxed yet more formal dining room with big tables. Big screen TVs are all over the place with every sports show imaginable running. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Beer selection is good with a number of popular standards and some Arizona craft beers as well. \n\nThe menu is extensive and builds on the pub food theme but without trying to be \"cute\" or bizarre, two all too common traits in Scottsdale. Food is recognizable from description. They don't give things freaky names. Menu descriptions tell you what you're going to get. \n\nOkay, order the onion rings. They're just great. They are crisp but cooked, lightly battered and FRESH, not out of a box. They a little spicy and that was fun. The platter is pretty big for \\$5.99 and all that the three of us could put away. \n\nBecause it had been forever for all of us, each ordered the Monte Cristo which is a featured menu item. It arrived in neatly arranged quarters with fries (other options are available) and a side of raspberry jam. Let's just say, this sandwich rocked and if it's any indication of what the rest of the menu is like, this place is a keeper. The sandwich was stuffed with meat and cheese, then properly battered and deep fried before being cut and plated. It wasn't just thrown on the grill. It was properly fried. Yummy. Again, not something to eat every day but an old favorite that was fun to meet again. \n\nOur server was cheerful, efficient and attentive (thanks, Hannah) and added a lot to our experience. I'm holding off on a fifth star until I've tried some other things on the menu, but I will be back. \n\nThe only down-side was the hostess who seemed fried from the heat, but aren't we all in August? We were in for a late lunch so perhaps she just needed a break. Nothing wrong at all, just not the bouncy, happy greeting we were perhaps expecting. I can overlook this easily.

We always use a laundry service because A, we hate to fold, and B, it is usually around the same price as doing it ourselves, but works with our busy schedules.

The place is like an upscale Zipps with nice sized flat screens everywhere. The hostess greeted us with a friendly smile and was very accommodating with our three table changes (first one wasn't by the game we wanted, second table was fine, but then we ran into friends and needed a bigger table). The wings are yummy, but I could have used a moist towelette at the end (bathrooms are for wussies). My date got the Texas burger that looked delicious. Apparently it was because by the time I finished my second wing, there were only a few pieces of bun left on his plate. The fries are along steak fries size, but crispy, which is fun. I got a side salad with my wings, which is a fairly decent portion with the tomatoes diced into yummy bite sizes.

I ordered the Hot Pastrami sandwich at the recommendation of the waiter. This was by far the BEST HOT PASTRAMI I can even remember.

I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! \n\nDespite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.\n\nHere are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.\n\nGo here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!\n\nP.S.

It's literally taking me time trying to come up with something positive to say here. \n\nCons\nA lot of food was out buffet style and it looked old and reheated.\nThe food and salsa was bland. Why would a place like this not have made to order hot fresh food?\nThe menu was hard to read, change the font and overall style of it.\nAbout 60% of the tables had dirty plates on them. When we left there were still dirty tables and no it wasn't busy. If the front of the house is unkept, I can't even image what their back looks like.\n\nOverall\nI would be willing to give them another try but I'm honestly scared of getting food poisoning. There is a lot of food out and I doubt they throw it all away every night.

Laura took care of us and did a great job being our server. We started the festivities off with the happy hour nachos which comes with ground beef, sour cream, pico de gallo, cheese and jalepenos. The nachos were ok but nothing spectacular.\n\n Then my favorite part of the evening came next, they had Strawberry Lemonade on the menu,,,,,,,,,,Win! My wife loves Strawberry Lemonade and this Blue 32's version was definitely 5 stars. Every restaurant we go into she asks if they serve Strawberry Lemonade, the answer is usually no. Then she asks if they have Rasberry Lemonade and the answer is usually no. Then the server will respond that they have regular pink lemonade (the smart servers usually offer to have the bartender attempt to make the drink anyways). And she ends up having water. Needless to say, we saved a good 5 minutes in the ordering process.\n\nMy sons wolfed down the bacon cheeseburgers with the fries. They commented on how the fries were different and very tasty. Obviously the burgers were tasty as well. My wife enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich with the honey mustard. \n\nI had the Monte Cristo Sandwich which comes with this outstanding rasberry jam and fries. But I swapped out my fries for onion rings for an extra buck. The sandwich is cut into quarters, although I wish it was cut into halves since the meat kinda slips out of the bread when cut into quarters. I enjoyed the Monte Cristo, it was ok but not outstanding. However, the rasberry jam saved the day and made the Monte Cristo very tasty, I even had to ask for some more jam. Their Onion Rings are some of the best I have ever had (they also have them on the happy hour menu). The bill came to \\$57.03 for 4 entrees, 4 drinks and an appetizer. Part of the equation in rating any restaurant for me is the value for the meal when combined with the taste of the food, service and ambiance. And definitely \\$15 per head including the tip (excluding the appetizer) is reasonable for dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

My usual Scottsdale sports bar lineup was not producing, and I needed a place to watch the NLCS. What to do? Well, I turned to Blue. \"You're my bar, Blue! You're my bar.\"\n\nI'm one intense Giants fan with certain game watching behaviors - sometimes I wear eye black or paint my face, I may jump around a lot so I need a little space, I get decked out head to toe in my team's colors, I'll curse and talk to the TV under my breath, I'll cheer with excitement, I may bite you if you block my view of the TV (just kidding, or am I?) and I like to heckle anyone who isn't rooting for the same team as me. What can I say? I'm fierce and I love the game. My father raised one heck of a sports fan. I've got a lot of pride in my team, and not every sports bar can accommodate my love for the San Francisco Giants. \n\nFurthermore, I knew I needed some pop in my Scottsdale sports bar batting order but I wasn't quite sure where I was going to find it. I had heard about this Blue character but I didn't know if he would cut it in my MLB - Major League Bars. Well, Blue threw on his # 32 jersey and proved to be an All-Star player by coming through in this clutch situation. Blue 32 is a quality bar with an exceptional atmosphere. What a great acquisition! Blue 32 covered all the bases.\n\nBase One - Blue possesses great range in the outfield by strategically placing a ton of TVs throughout the restaurant. TVs galore! Every spot is manned and defended by a TV so it's impossible to miss a play. These huge TVs provide great visibility from all angles. That way, there are less call discrepancies. I can see all the plays up close and personal, allowing me to critique a pitcher's pitch, a batter's swing or an ump's call.\n\nBase Two - Blue's wait staff turned multiple 6-4-3 double plays because no one dropped or boggled the customer service ball. The bartender, the hostess, the servers, et al were attentive, friendly and fun. This gold glove caliber defensive team is on top of their game. Blue 32's service may even earn a spot in my Major League Bar Hall of Fame if this excellence continues. \n\nBase Three - Blue 32 hit a grand slam with a delicious and high-quality yet reasonably priced menu. The food was excellent and definitely a home run with Matt and I. Matt ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy, which he raved about. And I'm not a sandwich person but this one looked so good - packed to the brim with crispy shrimp and accompanied by some real stand out onion rings. I ordered the grilled salmon dish with rice and broccoli, and I was shocked. Not by the rice and broccoli, as it was good, but my goodness it was the salmon! For about \\$15, this salmon is blacked and grilled perfectly, not over cooked or chewy at all and it was so moist! Bar salmon that actually tastes good? I'm in.\n\nHome Base - Overall, Blue 32 just has a superior sports watching atmosphere. It gives off high class sports bar vibes as its sparkling clean compared to other places. I am so excited to come back that I'll probably skip a couple of the other bars in my rotation. The d\u00e9cor, lighting and seating are all set up for an ultimate fan like me. This place even has excellent parking, a wonderful patio and the interior is large but it isn't gaping. It's the perfect size. I even love the full-size bar area with lights underneath. On one of the walls there's an awesome sports ticker with stats and breaking news. They also have an excellent happy hour with really fantastic deals from 4-7pm, so it fits my after work schedule. Even their cocktail, beer and wine menu gets the job done.\n\nWell Blue 32, your versatility has earned you starter status. I'm counting on you when I've got some serious game watching to do - and you better not disappoint. Your 5 star contract is riding it. I've got high expectations, and a great feeling that you'll succeed as the big bat in my Scottsdale sports bar lineup.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

I called Thursday to verify that all of us (4 ppl total) could each use a Groupon & the employee I spoke to said yes, I also reserved a lane just in case they were busy that night.\n\nWe got there around 9:30pm & thank goodness we reserved a lane because it was packed. I presented my Groupons & was told we couldn't use them towards cosmic bowling, WTF?! The manager came over & explained that they cannot use the Groupon coupon code with cosmic prices, I was pretty annoyed so he gave us a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free games. We bought 2 extra games & then headed over to our lane. \n\nThey had pretty good music playing & cool lighting. Idk if we just took our sweet ass time but we only got to play 3 of the 4 games. We had a lot of fun though! One thing that did kind of suck was that they closed at midnight, I am used to playing till 1am or later when we do cosmic. I almost forgot to mention the food/drinks. The soft pretzels with cheese were actually really good, as were the fries. The chicken fingers & grilled cheese were not as good, way too greasy. But it's bowling food so whatev! The pitchers of beer were \\$2 off so we got 2 for a lil under \\$15. \n\nAll in all it was a good time so we'd definitely return!", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

The place is clean, including the bathrooms. I'm not a bowling aficionado, so I can't say if it's up to pro standards, but it was perfect for our work party on a Saturday afternoon. They have Kiltlifter and Hop Shock IPA on tap! They also served pizza, salad, wings and some other munchies. I didn't try the food but it looked pretty good and seemed to be enjoyed by my coworkers. Another big plus is that the rental shoes and balls were not all skanky looking!

That's the bottom line for me when it comes to Blue 32. Every wall is lined with flat screen tvs playing every game imaginable. If there's a big game on, you better be early because this place will be packed. I look at Blue 32 like a sports bar and for a sports bar, this is definitely above par if you're comparing it to other sports bars in the area. \n\nThe food is decent but doesn't blow me out of the water. Think of it like your generic bar food with a slight culinary twist. We started with the artichoke dip which came with long piece of soft and tasty bread and the waitress added a bowl of chips. The dip hit the spot. Following, we shared a wrap since we'd had a late lunch. We got the chicken, avocado bacon wrap with fries. The wrap was good and could have maybe used a little bit more zing to it but it also hit the spot. The fries were tasty and also could have used a bit more seasoning but I ate them anyway so I guess I can't complain! \n\nAgain, this is a great place to come and watch a game (or 30) at one time and the bonus is that they have decent food you can eat while you watch. This is one of the reviews I'd like to give a 3.5 to but due to the impressive number of flat screens, I'm rounding up to a 4 star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

If I had only been there to watch a game I might give this place about 4 stars, but I'd had a long day, wanted to watch a game and unwind with a couple glasses of wine and some dinner.\n\nI stopped in recently with a friend when  in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than 4 and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying. \n\nWe ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread. \n\nBoth the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about 5 minutes in the toaster oven.  \n\nThe salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I  think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

Sure why not. \n\nFor about \\$40, the two of us had unlimited bowling plus shoes on a Saturday night. Not too shabby! \n\nThis joint is clean, up to date and well run. Which is huge! Considering how most bowling places are falling apart and operated by swamp people that collectively have 17 teeth.\n\nYou've got your fun colored lights, trendy music mixed with oldies, lots of operating TVs playing music videos, game room, food and beer. The patrons were a happy mix of young, old, families and pros. \n\nMy only complaint is the ball selection. They're color coded to make it easy to find the weight you're looking for, but the finger holes are pretty much the same size within each weight. Meaning you have to have tiny little girl fingers to use the lighter weights or massive bear hands to use the heavier ones. I kinda fall in the middle and had a hard time finding a ball that I liked.

I've been 3-4 times and have haircut results that range from average to very good, depending on the stylist.  I can't recall my favorite barber's name but she is from the Chicago area, with accent and all.  She does a nice 100% scissors cut (none of this excessive use of electric clippers with #2 or #4 whatever, like they do at Supercuts).\n\nPrices are reasonable.  Parking isn't a problem.  Only complaint is they're not always open on time in the morning.

Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  My wife ordered the pastrami sandwich with fries.  She liked the pastrami but disliked the roll.  The REAL disappointment was my order of Tacos al Carbon, noted as a \"house favorite\" on the menu.  Really?  A plate of three Mexican street tacos with a side of cilantro rice that seemed liked it had been sitting in a steamer for hours.  Surprising that my \\$12 taco plate paled by comparison to the approximately \\$4 I'd pay for a tastier plate at a local taco stand. Do better Blue 32.

There are a million tvs evenly dispersed throughout the whole place - so plan to come here to watch any sport your heart desires.  The service is hit or miss.  I've had wonderful service and some so-so service.  Overall I highly recommend this over Zipps (my old fave) to eat, drink, and watch sports at.  The price of the food is equal to Zipps, but I'm pretty sure Blue 32 has a lot more (and tastier) options.  Great for a quick work lunch, too - they get the food and check to you fast.

Fourth order ,Fried Chicken , deep-fried tasting of shrimp and smothered in a barely edible, \"corn-starchy\" sauce.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

We started with an awesome chips and queso appetizer with tortilla shell bowls holding the queso and salsa.  It wouldn't be a bad place to watch a game either, as they have tv's at every angle all over the restaurant. There wasn't a bad seat in the house.  They also kept it cool enough inside that my aunt was able to get the soup she had been craving which the hot weather didn't allow for her to make at home like she could in Chicago.  I tried the Southwest Salad, minus the chicken, which was good.  It needed more spice, which I assume probably came with the chicken portion of the meal. I would have preferred it doused all the way in chipotle ranch sauce instead of it drizzled on top of a tossed balsamic vinaigrette for an ultimate Southwest feel.

I ordered a turkey bacon sandwich which came on bread that was so over toasted it was close to being burnt.  Also, the description of my sandwich said that it was going to come with fries that had onions on them.  I didn't receive any onions.  \n\nMy son had the kid's mac & cheese which was quite large for a kid's meal.  He ate it all so I'm guessing he liked it.  \n\nI do have to say though that the chocolate cake dessert with a scoop of ice cream was REALLY good.

We went in on a Friday night and it was busy, so we took a high-top in the bar. We were greeted right away, but with the number of customers they had, it took awhile for our food to come out. The manager came over and asked us if we would like an appetizer or salads on the house and we declined (it didn't even feel like we'd be waiting a long time). The food came out about 5 minutes after the manager left and they brought us a free pizzookie at the end of our meal. \n\nCan't ask for better service! I love their deep dish pizza as well- dead on to Chicago-based places like Giordannos or Lou Malnottis :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "00eGk1ntf4RiDxVRY3gaIw"}

There are more Tv's in here than an Best Buy and not a bad seat in the house. For that fact alone I will be back.

I can't wait to go back to catch a bears game in September.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

And the trailer is great too!", "type": "review", "business_id": "00FGafv0TKfmH_QhVxh4FQ"}

It's the best sports bar food I've had in the area, the booths are really comfortable and there are a ton of high quality HD TVs. I've been there for Oregon football games, which are always fun (except when we play an Arizona school), as well as Arizona basketball games and the NCAA tournament. I've also been there randomly when I'm craving their boneless wings...\n\nOne of the best memories I have in AZ was at Blue 32 watching the Sweet 16 game this year between Arizona and Duke. Seeing the roof blown off by all the U of A fans was pretty special...It reminded me of the fanaticism that I see in Oregon for Duck football. That's what's so great about Blue 32. It's not 100% crazy, but there's always a good energy going, with the occasional freakout moment when Derrick Williams throws down on what seems like the entire Duke starting 5...\n\nAs far as food goes, I love their boneless buffalo wings. They also have good onion rings and fries, and their burgers, sandwiches and salads are also pretty good. They have a great happy hour with cheap appetizer options (cheap boneless wings!!!) and good beer specials.\n\nThere's ample parking and outdoor seating as well. There isn't a bad seat in the house because they have so many TVs. Regardless of where you're sitting you'll be able to watch what you came to watch. If it's really busy, service gets pretty slow, so keep that in mind if you end up here during a big game. Overall, Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

The nachos are packed real high with cheese, chicken, salsa...ohhhh, just name it and they will throw it on there. \nThis is my go-to place to watch football or any other sporting event that might be on. \nThanks Blue 32 for opening doors in my neighborhood!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

There are SEVERAL Bowl games being aired. So, when my in-laws suggested we go there for lunch, I was immediately nervous about having to wait an inordinate amount of time to even get into this place.\n\nShockingly, right during peak Bowl game time, the place was practically empty! This afforded me the opportunity to marvel in the sports majesty of Blue 32. I mean, there are t.v.'s EVERYWHERE in this place! There isn't a single seat in the house that isn't facing multiple televisions, which is great, since they air so many sports channels at the same time.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is divided into three separate sections: the bar, high-tops, and booth seating. Being that we had a little one with us, we opted for the booth seating. \n\nThe booths are very spacious. Our party consisted of four adults and one toddler, and we each had arm room and table space to spare. To make the booths a little more inviting, the backs of each booth appear to be considerably taller than in most restaurants. Given the rowdiness that can stem from sporting events, these high-backed booths offer a small hint of intimacy if you're looking to have a conversation with the rest of your party.\n\nNow, as I mentioned, the restaurant was really empty by Bowl game crowd standards. For some reason, it took a considerable amount of time for our waitress to greet us after we were seated. After that, it took even longer for our food to arrive at the table. When it did arrive, though, it was pretty good. Typical bar fare is wings and fried foods. Here, they have a full menu of great burgers, chicken, salads, and seafood. \n\nFor four adults and one toddler, ordering three entrees, two appetizers, and two alcoholic beverages, our final bill came out to around \\$60.00...during happy hour. So, during prime time, I'm sure the bill would have been considerably higher.\n\nWhile we were leaving, I noticed that they do have an AWESOME covered patio. There are a few televisions, misters, and a few fans to help keep you cool during the summer.\n\nSo, the atmosphere was awesome, the food was good, the service was eh. If you're looking for a great place to catch a game and have a beer, this is definitely a great candidate. If you're looking to be wowed by cuisine and service, perhaps you should try another place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

The service was quite uncomfortable...the server moved sooo slow, and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  When I ordered a beloved Estrella Damn Lager, the server had no idea what I was asking for and responded with a big : \"HUH?!\"  Then he dropped off the beer, started to walk away THEN asked for my ID.  Akward.....then we were all ready for our bills, it took him forever to come around...when we finally saw him near our table, someone from the party had to flag him down because he wasn't going to stop by.  Then after collecting payments from everyone, it took about 10 minutes for him to bring them all back.  The server seemed quite overwhelmed by our party of 10 that mostly ordered beer and appetizers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "00eGk1ntf4RiDxVRY3gaIw"}

This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend \\$30 for \\$50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.

While the food is quite delicious and the service rather fast (unless it's during a large sporting event), there are also some great happy hour specials.  Happy Hour is from 3-7 PM Monday through Friday.  It includes specially priced appetizers and drinks.  \n\nAs mentioned above, large sporting events may result in a longer wait time for service, but with all of the televisions and the great ambiance for sporting events, Blue 32 is a great place to go especially if you're planning on being there for a while for a game watching.  Just remember to ask for your check well before you plan on leaving.\n\nThere is also a convenient location near Scottsdale and the 101, which works with the Harkins Theatres next door to offer specials.

What I love, is that if it can be cleaned... it will be cleaned... to PERFECTION! I trust the entire team here to clean everything from down comforters to silk dresses. I even bring in my jackets that needed pockets sewn or buttons attached.\n\nThere is no over-promising either. Last New Years I worked an event and practically ruined my silk dress that had a train as I ran around and attended to spills, pouring champagne, etc. I brought the dress in and the owner took a look and said it would be almost impossible to clean but he could try. I gave them as much time as they needed to clean the dress. 5 days later, it was ready for pickup and looked almost brand new!!! I trusted them to do what they know and do best - and it worked.\n\nThis is a great, local-owned business that takes pride in the services they offer and their customer service!", "type": "review", "business_id": "015GCpe-tMj1En4NORROzA"}

It's always better to call ahead and make a reservation if you want to go cosmic bowling, or even regular bowling. Nice Lanes and a fun way to spend some competive time with your buddies! \n\nWhy Cosmic Bowling Rocks:\nMusic\nDisco lights\nLate at night", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

So when a group of friends put together an outing here, I had to come.  We bowled on a Saturday afternoon around 1 pm and the place was wide open.  They had the black lights, neon, loud music, and lasers going on...kind of weird to have cosmic bowling in the middle of the day....whatever, it was cool.\n\nWe paid \\$20 for 2 of us to play 2 games each....\\$5 per game.  Price comes with the shoes.  The selection of bowling balls is kind of limited.  It took us a little while to find a ball for us to use.  Bowling was fun though...very laid back and everyone had a good time.\n\nThe food options here are ok....Hot Dogs, Pizza, Fries....typical bowling alley food.  On the plus side...they serve Nathan's Hot Dogs...so at least they're quality.  The Pizza is plain though...below average.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brunswick-via-linda-lanes-scottsdale?select=W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w#W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w\n\nSome other notes - They also have a pool table in another room.  There are lockers available to store your stuff.  If you want to drink alcoholic beverages, they have a small lounge/bar...will have to check that out next time.\n\nOverall, it was a very good time.  Since it's in the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

Lived here for over 30 years and visited tons of sports bars - this one ranks up as one of the best I've been to yet.  Don't let the outside fool you with it's pretty fountains in the middle of \"yuppy\" Scottsdale.  Nice decor inside but nothing over the top - t-shirt and shorts kind of place.  If you're into sports - more TV's than you know what to do with.  Hubby and I ordered more food than we needed just to check out different things and all were incredibly good!  Monte Crisco sandwich, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders - all some of the best we've tasted and the prices were surprisingly decent.

I guess the staff was winding down from a hectic night, but regardless, the give-a-care factor wasn't present.  Portions were decent.  One of the prearranged silverware bundles was missing a knife.  Bathroom was clean.  Background music was soft.\n\nThe only thing that saved this place was the quality of the mix drinks and the fact that our party of 3 was in no rush.", "type": "review", "business_id": "00eGk1ntf4RiDxVRY3gaIw"}

I was just driving by and spotted this place and decided to try it out.  I was impressed there were mostly Latinos in there, in fact everyone but me, so I figured the food must be good.\n\nI mainly went in for seafood and the Ceviche tostada I got was excellent.  But it was a cold day so I got a bowl of Caldo de Res, which I had never had before, and it was sooo good.  Perfect!  I left satisfied and with a warm tummy. I hope it's still there when I come back so I can eat there again!\n\nSeptember 29, 2012:  \nI'm back in town and returned here late this evening.  I stand by my original review and opinions.  The girl behind the counter was extremely nice, the place smelled wonderful and the food was delicious.  There was not a thing wrong with the entire experience.  I had no gastronomic problems after.  I recommend this place with no hesitation.  \n\nI got a Ceviche Tostada because I remembered how good it was last time and it didn't disappoint.  I made a last minute decision to get the huge Chile Relleno on display and it may have been the best one I've ever had in 30 years of enjoying them.  I mean, what more do we want?  Great food, clean, Mexican band blaring.

Located in the Artesia Center at Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend, this newly opened (couple of years ago) spacious eatery has large booths at the rear for a business or family meal or bar tables and out door patio spaces for a more social-meet your friends on Sunday-type of gathering. The bar is enormous and inviting, too! The menu is American but one special is my favorite-the grilled salmon salad with glazed walnuts, goat cheese and cranberries is outstanding! I go there just for that! Prices are really reaonsable and wait staff is friendly and attentive! No waiting for 10 minutes to get a menu and order! Highly recommended!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

And never dawned on me to write a review since most people go to closest dry cleaners to their house. But there yelp page seemed unloved so I took one for the team and wrote the first review. \n\nThe women who work here are super nice. They do an excellent job with both laundry and dry cleaning. And the price is not to bad for dry cleaning, I recently picked up 15 articles both dry cleaning/laundry and it was 30 bucks! And that was before my discount as a returning customer. \n\nThe only downside is that this place shares a parking lot with Arcadia Grill. Which I have never been too but based on their lack of parking and over use of valet service means lack of parking. So just dont expect to pick up your laundry durning lunch time. Though there is a drop off only parking spot, but just one.

This place is real clean and service for the most part is great.  The front counter guy can't seem to multitask very well, but a lot of the patrons in line were kinda rude and couldn't wait their turn.  They were very helpful to assist when they noticed we had a 4 year old with us... offered a smaller ball and asked if wanted bumpers and a ramp.  I was asked to join the bonus zone, so glad I did... got massive coupons and offers right away.  My kid loves the mini corn dogs and the arcade (that was his review).

So I wanted to see if eating food would help and would take away my weird stomach pains.  The guys ordered the pizza kind of late so I was dying by the time the pizza came out. Even though I ordered the ginger pomegranate sparkler which unfortunately did not help as much as I would have liked.  The pizzas were so much better than I expected because the last time that we came my burger was so bland.  I absolutely hated it.  But the other day changed my mind, those pizzas were awesome. Not my absolute favorite or anything but i look forward to the next visit so that way I can try different toppings.  I heard the pizookie was just okay and okay doesn't tempt me ever to try it, I will be sticking to the pizzas and sparklers from now on ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "00eGk1ntf4RiDxVRY3gaIw"}

I don't think I've ever given a 1 before.  But this place deserves it.  Super Bowl Sunday.  We arrive and the place is probably 25-33% empty.  We are then informed that everything is by invitation.  Wouldn't have a problem with that, except that we looked at the website last week and again today, no mention of invitations.  Just around the block from us, and we were looking forward to finding a nice place to go on the weekends to watch games... we found it.

I love a good sports bar, and it is close to home.  Hopefully the service will get better.  Our waitress told us she was sorry for the delay, but they were \"getting busy\" - maybe a third of the booths were filled.  She didn't come by to fill water, check on us and took forever to get a beer and glass of wine to the table.  This was the first pre-season Cardinals game, so they should have been prepared for customers.  The food is really good - but be warned, it is heart attack food.  I have eaten at the bar and received better service.  One more item that drives me crazy in a sports bar:  there were a lot of babies crying and dirty looks sent over to tables getting loud with guys yelling profanities that young kids probably shouldn't be around.

But in the end I am not very impressed. \n\nLet's start with the first thing that sets the tone for your dining experience, the hostess and wait staff. This was my third time there and we arrived during Saturday College Football. It was me and three buddies. The hostess had no idea what was going on and she was walking us to a table in the bar when two other people took it from right in front of us. Instead of her telling them to get up she made us wait. We waited for close to an hour. \n\nFinally we get a seat at the bar. Now the TV situation at Blue 32 ss great...if you have an in with the guy managing the TV Remote. We were there for the GAME OF THE WEEK and they insisted the ASU vs NO ONE CARES game was more important. I don't think the bar manager got the memo that 85% of the US who watches college sports was watching the game of the week. \n\nNow to the food. Decent not great. I have had their tacos, wings and burgers all of which were nothing but mediocre at best. \n\nIf I could fuse the set up of Blue 32 with the food from Zipps or Goldies then we would have a real Scottsdale Sports Bar.

Staff is very helpful and nice.  Im far from the best bowler and this environment allows for me to still have fun with my family and friends. I just got off the phone with a staff member Deana, and she was sooooooo helpful and nice. I asked her a question about Sunday bowling, she told me all about how to get coupons for Sunday as well as a family package.

It's called Elite now, not Queens though.\nWe do our laundry here.  \nThey have a convenient drop off.  They give you a bag and you write your instructions on the tag and you never have to wait in line to drop off!\nThey are professional, on time and their work is really good too.  \nMy husband never complains about having a press mark at the bottom of his shirts like the 2.00 cleaners used to do.  \nIt is slightly more than the 2.00 cleaner, but this is close to home and we don't get attitude from the employees like at the 2.00 cleaners.  \nThe owner is usually on site and you can just tell that he cares about his customers. \nIt's right on the corner of 48th St and Indian School by the Arcadia Tavern.  They also do free pick up and delivery and if you call in advance when you're on your way they'll get your order ready and deliver to your car!  Seriously what else can you ask for?  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "015GCpe-tMj1En4NORROzA"}

It was bland and boring. Not worth \\$14 for sure! \n\nSecond visit, I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup. Upon it's arrival it was obvious it had been sitting in a Cambro in the walk-in for a couple days. Seriously, it came out cold and congealed.  I put my spoon in the bowl and bounced it on top of the soup jello. Giving benefit of the doubt, I had them refire it. It came out scalding Hot and I burnt my tongue (did they do that on purpose?). The flavor was ok but I kept thinking why am I bothering to eat this slop?! \n\nBottom line, the food is frozen and made in bulk.

It also took awhile to just get a beer.  I ordered a simple meal and one beer and still didn't get to leave for over an hour!  I had to go to the bartender b/c the waiter was nowhere to be found and the manager had to cash me out.  I came back later that day, and literally stood in a packed bar for over 1 1/2 hours.  After being told by the hostess that a waitress is serving the area, I never once was offered a beer or anything to drink.  The waitress in the area just ignored me.  Their service is the worst i've ever seen in my entire life.  Blue 32 in Hermosa is much better.  I will never go to this bar again nor will I endorse it for anyone.  It's the worst bar in scottsdale as far as I'm concerned.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

GREAT location, GREAT size and TV's everywhere.  I visited on Thursday, the opening of the NFL season and they were HUGELY understaffed and they acted surprised they would be that busy, our waiter and commented many times and there were 2 bartenders to accomodate all?  Seriously!  HELLO! , you opened a sports bar!   Over staff and send your employees home.   \nAlso, the AC was cranked, and there were tables where the air was blowing down and you couldn't comfortable sit there.  And the mega fan didn't need to be on mach speed....a moderate fan speed makes sense.  The misting system was on well after sun set and it was feeling damp, as you recall Thurs temps were nice on their own. \nHope you get it together before my next visit.  \nON a positive note, the Hot Wing salad was great and I like that you make your own dressing and the blue cheese dressing actually had REAL chunks of cheese....thumbs up there!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

I was being treated for my birthday (it was actually on Thursday the 22nd) so I was hoping for a good time. Last time we split a Chicago pan pizza which was really huge and good. The greeter took us right to our table near the bar and in perfect view of the start of the Laker game. \n\nOur server was a great help in narrowing down our choices as we both wanted to try something new besides the pizza. I ordered the chicken parm and he had the cheese tortellini. Both came out after about 20 minutes which seemed longer given that I had missed breakfast but was worth it when I saw the food. Nice looking chicken breaded and baked till crispy not soggy. They also did not skip on the cheese which was a great thing in my book as I am a big cheese freak LOL.\n\nEverything was great until I tasted the pasta sauce. Instead of mumm, it was more like What the hell is this! All I can say is yuck! The sauce tasted like a can of tomato sauce, mixed with one of those season packets from a pack of chicken flavored top ramen. Now I do not like to send my food back (seen to many of those caught on camera specials on fox I guess) but I had to this time. I asked the waitress if this is the main sauce they use for all their dishes and she said yes except for the pizza. Thank goodness for that was my thought. \n\nThat left me with very limited choices so I decided to just finish my meal with a order of mozzarella sticks. The chicken parm was removed and was taken off our bill which was great but left me with the birthday blues. After about the second cheese stick I was ready to go. My buddy was buzzing like a happy little bee after the two beers and a double shot of Irish whiskey he had so we paid the check and left.\n\nNow I know this place does one thing and does it really well and that is Pizza.

Can get 20 pound bags for 2.40.  Which is not bad, considering Costco is about 1.70 a bag.  The best part is I don't have to go all the way to Arrowhead to get ice.  Another interesting note is that the owner told me the 20 pound bags are more like 22 pounds.  \n\nThey also sell reverse osmosis, filtered water at .30 a gallon.  Bring your own jugs or you can buy them here.  \n\nWhat really attracted me to this place you ask??  The Thrifty ice cream sign.  I am a sucker for ice cream and it has been years since I have had Thrifty ice cream.  So in I went and enjoyed a scoop of Rocky Road goodness for \\$1.80 on a cone. \n\nIf you are looking for ice, filtered water, or some ice cream to cool off in Surprise this could be your next destination.  They are open 7:30 to 7 Monday through Friday and Saturday 10 to 5 I believe.

Bring a scarf and parka, for if you sit at the high tables, you could freeze to death.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

My husband and I found the food to be tasty and waitstaff service to very good however when he found a hair in his sandwich and spoke to the waitress and followed by a stop by the table from the manager our impression of the restaurant went downhill FAST.  The manager stopped and asked if everything was ok, we asked if she was asking about the hair.  She said they do wear hats in the kitchen, like she had on.  Offered a new sandwich after 3/4 of the sandwich was eaten and that was it.  I would have expected a more sincere caring for finding hair in the sandwich.  Will not be going there again due to the manager experience.  Wait person was very nice and extremely caring.

He was awesome!! I asked a million questions and he took the time & answered all of them; he didn't seem rude and definitely had patience for me so that was great. I am definitely buying one this yr  and hopefully he will still be there.

For some reason, I also used to go south when I wanted to go bowling, but I now realize I should have gone north instead! After a day of spring training, we decided to make a stop by Brunswich Via Linda lanes for a couple hours of bowling fun and fun it was!\n\nI don't know what it is, but bowling alleys always strike me as shady but right off the bat, I was completely impressed with how \"non-shady\" this bowling alley was. I could tell that this is a family-fun spot and one that is frequented often by locals. The bowling alley itself has several lanes, a fully loaded arcade room, a bar, food and even a \"gift shop\" with bowling essentials! Sadly we didn't have any socks, but luckily for us, they had a vending machine that also sold socks. Yes they were a little overpriced at \\$2.50 but that's what we get for forgetting our own socks at home! The venue itself was clean and I didn't feel icky using the community shoes and bowling balls. In addition, they have hand santizer so I was able to get a swift cleaning to my hands after turn of bowling and before digging into the tasty popcorn. \n\nNow let's move on to the reason people come here: the bowling. It ended up being cheaper to purchase two hours of unlimited bowling so we went for that. While I won't be joining a pro bowling league anytime soon, it was a lot of fun and the bowling game went along seamlessly and without any issues! However, since we went for the two hours of unlimited bowling, it shut off right at two hours which didn't let us finish our game, so if you go that route remember to keep an eye on the clock! \n\nI have definitely found my new neighborhood bowling alley and can't wait to come back again. I might even join a bowling league. Any takers?", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

The bowling itself is great, it's a great facility.  The pricing is great as well.  Ten bucks for unlimited games until midnight on Sunday's, can't beat that.  The food is good as well, really hard to complain since its bowling alley food.  And their drinks are priced fine as well.  \n\nMy only complaint is with the customer service.  The past several times I have come to This location, the staff at the front desk has just been downright rude.  From their very unfriendly greetings to their handling of requests, they seem to act as though they hate you no matter what.  God forbid you ask to split your group of six onto two lanes, regardless of how busy it is, you are rudely told that can't happen.  During my last trip there my group asked if we could use the empty lane next to us since we felt crammed on one lane.  The response from the guy behind the counter was \"well we could fit ten people on one lane of we wanted to, this is just the way it is\".  After pleading with him further he reluctantly agreed but made sure to tell us how much it inconvenienced him to have to place the next party one lane farther down, despite the place being half empty.  That is just one example of the typical rudeness I've encountered.\n\nOutside of that it is a good location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q"}

Also they have this program called world beer tour where you get some free goodies if you drink a certain amount (can we say promoting alcoholism? I'm down). This kinda reminds me of the old program they had going at rock bottom where they would put your name on the placard if you drank like over 100 beers (and you get like tshirts, free food, etc along the way)\n\nSecondly, the pizza is darn delicious there. I know it's a chain, but still great tasting pizzas with variety of toppings. I haven't got a chance to try anything other than the pizzas there, but hey isn't this supposed to be a pizza place? Mama mia. \n\nLastly, it's super close to my school and I have gotten take out a few times so another star for convenience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "00eGk1ntf4RiDxVRY3gaIw"}

One area is mostly high-top tables and is more bar-centric.  The other area is almost all large booths with plenty of space for 8+ folks per table.  \n\nThe TVs are EVERYWHERE and cover just about every seating angle.  It's definitely a sports bar that also has a big menu, not a restaurant that also shows sporting events.  Sound is turned up for most games so you had better be there for a game and not just to eat as there is no escaping the TVs and sound.\n\nThe good news is that if you are there to watch sports, there's plenty to like besides all the TVs.  There were over 15 beers on tap plus an equal number of bottled choices.  My wife said her mixed drink was well made and plenty strong - they also have a specialty drink list for those that like a little help selecting their beverage. \n\nThe menu was BIG and the food we ordered was very tasty.  My wife got the Rib Sampler off the appetizer list which consisted of four \"fall of the bone\" pork ribs that were served very hot and were really good.  I got the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was well made, had good crisp chicken, hot buffalo sauce, and lots of greens.  If there was one critique of the food list, it was that it could be a bit repetitive across the categories (e.g. Buffalo chicken wrap, salad, burger, strips, etc.)\n\nThe staff was friendly and accomodating - service was quick and they accepted a coupon I had from localdines for \\$30 of food with no issues (something I recommend grabbing if you are headed here anytime soon).\n\nwe'll definitely be back for whatever the next \"big game\" is - Blue 32 is a cut above the Zipps and Fox Sports Grills in Scottsdale and worth serious consideration for your next sports-fueled food fest might be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

The tours are awesome. Its just a great place to meet up for happy hour or just for a couple pints. I'm not into the food though. Its not bad....it's just not great. I guess  I'm looking for great. The best thing they have going is their pizza but If I'm going out for pizza, I can think of 3-4 places I'd rather go. However, none of those places have the beer selection that OC has.

We were really disappointed and the 4 friends left and went to Zipps... sorry Blue 32.. you just lost 6 customers.. Customer service is key... if you don't have that you lose people.. period....

He told the waitress in the bar - missed her name, unfortunately (dark, straight short hair, in her 30-40's) - that he wanted a Stone IPA. She delivered a 90-Shilling. He sent it back for the Stone IPA. AGAIN, she brought a 90-Shilling. Third time, she got it right. Same waitress left our table dirty during our 1-1/2 hour stay. It was visibly dirty when we sat down and she moved stuff around, but never cleaned it. And she was scarce for the majority of our stay... we had to flag her down multiple times for the simplest things. If this had been our first visit, we would never have gone back.\n\nThe food. Why, Old Chicago, must you keep messing with your menu? Each time we try something on the \"new\" menu, we are disappointed. The prices are higher and the food is less appetizing. Speaking of the food, raw bacon on a burger is not acceptable. When a customer asks for \"medium\", the burger shouldn't come out bordering on burnt. \n\nAnd then there is the fact that each time we visit, at least one of their specialty beers is out and they haven't updated the beer menu. You get all excited to see XYZ on the menu and then after waiter/waitress consults with bartender, you are told you are SOL. This is no exaggeration, it happens EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Would it be so difficult to take a Sharpie and cross out the beers that are out?\n\nWe are losing faith in Old Chicago.

The plus is there really is no competition in this part of town and the people are friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

I felt really welcomed when I visited Blue 32 -- it wasn't too rowdy nor too quiet either.  \n\nI ordered the Black and Blue burger, which definitely hit the spot.  Though, I do need to get my butt back to the gym.  Regardless, bleu cheese and bacon on a burger -- how can you say No!?  It was cooked perfectly and with fat yummy fries on the side.  Didn't order a drink unfortunately this time since my weekend hangover was still lingering haha!  \n\nService was okay; we were greeted with a smile.  Though I'm always irked when I have to wait for my water to be filled, but all is well.\n\nThe ambience was real chill for a sports bar, but like I said not too rowdy is good for me.  I like the spot lighting and the booth and bar separation was perfect. - Enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "01cEFI5Pq_RyEwM3GSTopQ"}

Booths are comfortable, bathrooms are clean, and our service from Jasmine was attentive too...\n\nUnfortunately, the food was just ok.  We started with chips, salsa, queso, and guac for the table... not bad.  Jared ordered a half dozen spicy wings next, which he said were not very meaty, but he liked the sauce.  For our meals, I had the salmon (which came with rice and broccoli and I added on a small house salad to start), our friend Jen had a Buffalo Chicken Salad, and Jared had the Blue 32 Turkey Reuben with fries (which I ate).  The homemade ranch dressing was good and everything else was fine; nothing amazing.  (My salmon was overcooked, rice was clumpy, and Jared's sandwich was soggy).\n\nBottom line:  Blue 32 is a higher end sports bar with decent food and a nice beer selection.  (They do have a bunch of local beer on draft, which is a nice touch).

I figured that was just what I needed to add to my list of places to watch the hapless Seattle Mariners (and Seahawks) - an upscale sports bar.  At least if my teams lose, I can watch in a comfortable environment.  And lose they did, 11-6, perhaps on their way to setting a season record for the most losses ever by a Mariner's team.\n\nBut I digress.  The Blue 32 is very nice, and I particularly like the way it is set up.  There is a very nice bar, all the requisite flat TV's,  and the sections are split up where everyone has an excellent view of the games.  \n\nMore importantly, the food is very good - much better than an average sports bar.  I had their Shrimp Poor Boy and it was wonderful.  The other diners sitting near me had everything from pasta to ribs to steak, and everything looked delicious.  I asked about Happy Hour specials for food, and they had not decided yet what they were going to have as specials (but they do have a list of Happy Hour drinks on their menu, and they do plan on adding some type of food specials at some time).\n\nI sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive.  She answered the menu questions I had, and was very on top of things.  I was very impressed that the servers were organized and efficient - especially since they had only been open for several weeks.\n\nThis is definitely a place that I will be visiting in the future.

What a fun place to hang out on a Friday/Saturday night. You'll need to wait till after 10pm (league fills the place till then), and preferably have a reservation. \n\nThe lounge was nice, drinks well done (though a little skimpy on liquor) and the munchies decent for a bowling alley.\n\nThe \"cosmic\" bowling was a blast with several of us drinking a little too much. I managed to win a few games, which certainly impacted my rating. The place is freaking BUSY! as most popular hangouts are... though with a surprisingly young hip crowd.\n\nLet the good times roll...
